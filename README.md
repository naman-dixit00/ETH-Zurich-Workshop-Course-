### Objective
The primary goal of this workshop is to teach researchers how to organize their computational work so that others (and their future selves) can replicate the exact same results using the same data, code, and software environment.

### Core Principles: "The Reproducibility Pillars"
To achieve reproducible results, the workshop focuses on four main areas:

1.  **Documentation (Computational Notebooks):**
    * Using **Jupyter Notebooks** or **RMarkdown**.
    * Combining live code, equations, and narrative text in a single document.
    * *Why:* It eliminates the "black box" where results appear without explanation.

2.  **Version Control (Git):**
    * Tracking every change made to scripts and code.
    * Using platforms like **GitLab/GitHub** for collaboration.
    * *Why:* To see exactly what changed in the analysis between "Version 1" and "Final Publication."

3.  **Environment Management (Software Stack):**
    * Creating isolated environments using **Conda**, **Docker**, or **Singularity**.
    * Exporting dependency files (e.g., `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`).
    * *Why:* Prevents the "It works on my machine" problem by ensuring everyone uses the same library versions.

4.  **Workflow Automation:**
    * Moving away from manual data processing.
    * Using tools like **Snakemake** or **Nextflow** to automate the pipeline from raw data to final plots.

###  Why It Matters for Your Lab
* **Trust:** Enhances the credibility of your published findings.
* **Efficiency:** Makes it easier to onboard new students to an existing project.
* **Compliance:** Meets the "FAIR" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles required by funding agencies.
